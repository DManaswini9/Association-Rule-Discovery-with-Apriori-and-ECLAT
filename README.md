# 🛒 Association Rule Discovery with Apriori and ECLAT

## 📖 Description
This project applies association rule mining techniques to transactional data to discover patterns in customer purchases. By using algorithms like Apriori and ECLAT, it identifies frequent itemsets and generates association rules, helping uncover product combinations that are often bought together. Such insights can drive better product placement, cross-selling strategies, and targeted marketing.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocess transaction data for analysis.
- Generate frequent itemsets with support thresholds.
- Extract association rules with confidence and lift metrics.
- Visualize rules and item relationships.
- Interpret findings for actionable business insights.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- mlxtend (for Apriori & ECLAT implementations)
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)
